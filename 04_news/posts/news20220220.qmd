**From pre-dawn coordination to late-night data checks, the daily rhythm of ODEKA A.S.B.L is a testament to dedication, ingenuity, and teamwork.**

While Raphaël has been coordinating motorbike drivers since 4:00 a.m. from our Procure office, using a radio to stay in contact across long distances, the drivers are sent to villages, sometimes 50 miles away, with the mission of bringing our intervention participants to town by 10.30 a.m. At 5:40 a.m. sharp, Philip, our guard and one of the region’s customary chiefs known for his charitable practice of magic, opens the gates of ODEKA A.S.B.L’s main compound. He welcomes Mama Beignet, a local baker who has prepared 14 bags of beignets. These will join the items Adrien is already arranging on the tables he has just set up outside: 14 tablets, 14 pouches, 14 batteries, and 14 instruction sheets.

These are the essential tools of our enumerators. It is crucial that the tablets are fully charged, no small feat in a town where electricity runs for only a few hours a day, and not every day, and that the pouches contain exactly the right amount of money needed for food, official and unofficial road barriers, potential motorbike repairs, and survey respondent payments. Carrying too much money would expose our teams to serious risks of assault, while too little would jeopardize the day’s work.

At 5:50, Elie and Jean-Freddy, always the first enumerators to arrive and both senior managers at ODEKA A.S.B.L, step through the gate. By 6:15 a.m., all 14 enumerators have arrived and departed for their missions. These are the elite of ODEKA A.S.B.L: some have been with us for almost ten years, and all are extraordinarily hardworking and dedicated to our baseline and endline surveys.

The human capital embodied in this team is remarkable. All are skilled motorbike drivers, capable of navigating without lights, GPS, or maps across vast regions with no proper roads or bridges, sometimes ferrying their bikes across rivers on pirogues. All speak and write at least three languages, French, Tshiluba, and Lingala, and are capable of administering surveys lasting up to four hours, involving complex research games and sensitive questions, often to respondents fearful of extortion or magic. They deploy the most sophisticated diplomacy, maintain rigorous accounts of their daily expenses, and fully understand the demands of conducting randomized controlled trials.

These men and women, the treasure and pride of ODEKA A.S.B.L, are the craftsmen of the data we produce.

After a few final adjustments and oral instructions, Adrien can brew a well-deserved coffee as Morgane and Romaine step onto the scene. Once participants arrive, they are greeted by another team of younger, yet highly trained enumerators. The same ballet of tablets, batteries, pouches, beignets, and instructions continues until around 9:30 a.m.

Raphaël meets the participants and their drivers, rushing between Kananga’s markets and churches to resolve small conflicts, again, diplomacy is essential. Lisette receives special attention: she is the enumerator responsible for collecting data for our local aggregate price index. She moves through the markets, gathering price information from merchants and consumers alike.

Meanwhile, Adrien, Morgane, and Romaine tackle the day’s administrative tasks: accounting records, stakeholder meetings, responding to administrative requests, purchasing materials, solving problems and conflicts, designing the next survey, writing reports, and running quality checks on the data. The workload is immense. They are supported by Papa Danny, our cook, who masters the art of keeping everyone’s stomachs healthy with only a brazier and a few utensils, and Mama Louisa, our cleaner, who keeps the dusty compound livable, hand-washing clothes, ironing with embers to protect against parasites, stitching mosquito nets, our only defense against malaria, and even deterring cockroaches with ingenious tricks.

At 3:00 p.m., the intervention enumerators return. Their daily reports are highly detailed, including numerous procedures to detect errors, intentional or not, and to verify distributed funds. By 7:30 p.m., the baseline and endline team is back, submitting even more complex reports. But the work doesn’t stop there: data cleaning must be done immediately, because tomorrow’s assignments depend on today’s results. This can take hours, with code to run, follow-up calls to enumerators already home, ad-hoc coding, and all work strictly documented according to best practices of replicability and transparency.

As dusk falls, one last challenge looms: electricity. Reliable power is vital not only for charging the tablets and batteries the teams use in the field, but also for running the computers needed for data cleaning and assignment generation. Will Kananga’s grid supply power tonight? Are our solar panels and batteries sufficient for a few more hours? Is the generator operational, and do we have enough affordable fuel? Is the cable linking us to the old train station (where state-provided generators were repurposed for local revenue) still intact and functional?

Only once these questions are answered does the day end, often around 9:30 p.m., when everyone finally shares a well-deserved dinner. ODEKA A.S.B.L’s people must go to bed early, because they rise early.

This is ODEKA A.S.B.L’s daily life, five days a week, Tuesday through Saturday. Sundays are lighter, with only intervention waves and payroll, a complex task since salaries include both a regular and a performance-based component. Mondays are nominally rest days, though often they become a mix of rest, administration, and cash withdrawals.

And of course, this daily rhythm is far from predictable. Kananga is an extremely poor environment with non-functional institutions, where even the simplest task can be disrupted by uncertainty and hazard. No two days ever look the same — and that unpredictability is one of the most exciting parts of working at ODEKA A.S.B.L.

But that, as they say, is a story for another post…
