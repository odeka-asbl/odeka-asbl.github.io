**End of a productive two-week visit marks the beginning of a new multi-year project for ODEKA A.S.B.L.**

ODEKA A.S.B.L.’s team in Kananga had the privilege of welcoming and working with principal investigators James Robinson and Jon Weigel over the past two weeks. They were accompanied by Mats Ahrenshop, a PhD student from Oxford University, to prepare a new research project exploring how securing land property rights could foster tax compliance.

The visit included focus groups with customary chiefs, lawyers, and citizens, as well as meetings with key stakeholders such as Governor Jon Kabeya Shikayi, Secretary of Finance Jim Mukenge, and Chief Kalamaba, King of the Lulua Bashilange. The local team, Eva Davoine, a PhD student from UC Berkeley visiting since May, Adrien Foutelet, and Morgane Garcia, worked closely with the principal investigators each day, contributing to the intervention design, the practical solutions envisioned, and the theoretical foundation of the forthcoming paper.

The team was particularly inspired by the principal investigators’ accessibility, generosity, and intellectual curiosity throughout the visit. Their openness to discussion and close collaboration made the experience both stimulating and deeply rewarding. The entire ODEKA A.S.B.L team was also delighted to learn that Eva Davoine will officially join the team of principal investigators, a development that had been under consideration for some time and is now confirmed.
