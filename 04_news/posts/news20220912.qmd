**The end of a six-week transition between the outgoing Country Director and the three new members of the Kananga team**

Robin Benabid Jegaden, the new Country Director, and Dylan Reich, the new Program Manager, arrived in Kananga in early August, where they joined Laure Lepine, the new Research Intern, who had arrived a few weeks earlier. The three will steer ODEKA A.S.B.L. through the months ahead.

Over six weeks, outgoing Country Director Adrien Foutelet introduced them to ODEKA A.S.B.L.’s employees, contractors, and partners, as well as key stakeholders in Kananga. They received extensive training on the organization’s management, current financial and HR priorities, and the scientific and practical dimensions of ODEKA A.S.B.L.’s main ongoing project, Religion & Development.

While the baseline phase of this project is now fully complete, the team will oversee one ongoing wave of intervention and prepare to launch the final, tenth wave in the coming weeks. The intervention phase is projected to conclude in about seven months. They will also manage the shorter but crucial endline survey waves, five of which remain to be conducted.

As Religion & Development enters its final stage, ODEKA A.S.B.L. is preparing to embark on a new horizon: Legal Antecedents of Fiscal Capacity, an ambitious project originally conceived by James Robinson. The three young researchers will play a key role as the practical hands in the field, devising concrete solutions and implementing actions in response to the principal investigators’ directives.

Meanwhile, Adrien Foutelet will transition to a new role as Director of Finance & Operations, joining Jonathan Weigel on the UC Berkeley campus to oversee project finances and serve as the day-to-day bridge between the field team and the principal investigators.

In the coming months, the Kananga team may welcome additional members, as the workload promises to grow significantly. Good luck to our three new recruits — and stay tuned!
