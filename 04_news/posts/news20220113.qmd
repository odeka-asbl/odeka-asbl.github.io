**After a short end-of-year break, ODEKA A.S.B.L begins 2022 reinvigorated, with new faces, new projects, and renewed ambitions.**

While we were sad to see Charlotte depart in early December at the end of her internship, Adrien left on December 16 for a three-week Christmas break. But ODEKA A.S.B.L.’s end-of-year pause was brief: just two weeks later, on January 1, Kananga welcomed Clara Sievert, a Ph.D. student at Harvard University supervised by Nathan Nunn, ODEKA A.S.B.L board member and principal investigator of the Religion and Development project.

Clara took over as interim country director during Adrien’s absence and, upon his return, continued to support the organization’s daily operations while also finalizing the design of her own randomized controlled trial (RCT) and preparing to launch it in Kananga. She will remain on site until late May.

And there is more to come for ODEKA A.S.B.L. In early February, Romaine Loubes, a student at the Paris School of Economics set to begin a Ph.D. in economics there next fall, will join the team. Romaine is currently visiting Harvard at Nathan Nunn’s invitation and will assist with our projects until April. A few weeks from now, Morgane Garcia, a Master’s student at ENS Lyon, will also join ODEKA A.S.B.L for a six-month internship, during which she will both contribute to the interventions and write her master’s thesis — possibly on a topic related to the research conducted by ODEKA A.S.B.L.

It was also announced that members of the Executive Board, including Jonathan Weigel and James Robinson, possibly accompanied by Ph.D. students, will visit Kananga during the summer months to lay the groundwork for a new research project. More details will follow in the coming months.

The entire ODEKA A.S.B.L team is thrilled to welcome this group of excellent students and dedicated collaborators. Good luck to everyone, and here’s to a year of ambitious research and exciting progress!
