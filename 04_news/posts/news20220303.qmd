**Two week of training and preparation at ODEKA A.S.B.L culminates in the smooth launch of the project’s first endline wave.**

After weeks of preparation and coding for the endline survey, the six-month deadline following the end of the first baseline wave was approaching, and everything had to be ready.

Our expert enumerator team grew from 14 to 18 members after a demanding selection process that promoted the best performers from our second-tier teams. This expansion allows the first team to be large enough to conduct both baseline and endline surveys simultaneously, a major step forward in our field capacity.

The 18 enumerators were relieved from fieldwork for a week of intensive training, during which the endline phase was presented to them in detail: how assignments are structured, how to handle respondents, how to confirm and document cases of participant attrition, and more. The endline questionnaire, containing hundreds of questions and research games that vary by enumerator type, was reviewed item by item over three days. All translations from English into French and Tshiluba were checked and finalized, with new items translated as needed.

Meanwhile, long Stata routines were prepared to clean the forthcoming endline dataset and to verify each new data addition through automated quality checks, routines designed to identify and flag potential sources of error. New tablets and batteries were sourced, and a new field-commuting system had to be designed: with baseline and endline missions now running concurrently across a vast area, it had become too demanding for enumerators to return to the office each night for reporting. Instead, enumerators are now reimbursed to stay in guest houses in the field, and a new system was created to track and verify these significant new expenses, a crucial matter for maintaining credibility with our funders.

Finally, the past two days marked the launch of the first endline wave and, incredibly, everything went smoothly. Surveys were completed on time, the data came in clean, and not a single major incident occurred.

But that’s not the whole story. In truth, a large part of the previous week’s preparation had been devoted to running a pilot phase: a full-scale rehearsal designed to identify every possible glitch before the real launch. And indeed, there were many: tablet synchronization errors, broken maps, a few mistranslated survey items, and plenty of last-minute improvisation. Thanks to that pilot, all these small issues were solved in time, and what looked like effortless success over the past two days was, in fact, the result of a week of hidden chaos: exactly as planned.
